  <h1>Our Mission</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Soli Deo Gloria.</strong> Genesis Revelation Inc exists for the glory of God alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is to advance the gospel of Jesus Christ and to faithfully steward,
    preserve, and share the knowledge, wisdom, and truth of God as revealed in Scripture
    — from Genesis to Revelation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This ministry is committed to serving the Church by providing Scripture-centered
    teaching, study resources, and biblical clarity that remain fully aligned with the
    Word of God. Our aim is to strengthen believers, encourage faithfulness, and point
    all people to Christ.
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything produced through Genesis Revelation Inc is offered freely as a gift,
    trusting that God Himself supplies what is needed for the growth and nourishment
    of His people.
